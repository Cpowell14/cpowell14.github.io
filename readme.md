Welcome to a small portfolio website project created by Carter Powell.

The goal of this project is to show the world who I am and what I've accomplished, 
in addition to showing some of my experience in front-end development.

This project utilizes concepts of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to compile a website in
which the end goal is to publish for people's inquires.

For questions, or if you would like to contact me please direct yourself to the webpage at www.carterpowell.com
for a handful of methods to contact me.

//This readme will be updated as the project moves through stages of development//
