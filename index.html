                    I'd just like to welcome, and thank you for taking interest in my life.
                    My name is Carter Powell, a graduate of the University of Nebraska who
                    has spent his entire life obsessed with technology and the mathematics 
                    behind it. During my adolescense loving mathematics and logic based
                    problems, my father helped spark my curiousity in computing by letting me 
                    build his desktop at 12 years old. From then on I knew what I wanted to do
                    with my life; however, throughout the stages of my life, I have also found 
                    other passions I enjoy that has shaped who I am today.

                <div class="subcontent_third_text_left">
                    One of those passions is my love for music. Starting in middle school the students in my class
                    and I were given a choice in art credits and I chose to play in the concert band. This originally
                    mandatory course turned into a major part in my life as I loved to express myself through music.
                    Since taking that very first concert band course, I've played trombone for 13 years in concert band
                    marching band, and pep band including fulfilling my ambitions in playing in the Cornhusker Marching Band for
                    4 years. On top of this, playing trombone also has given me the opportunities to perform in Carnegie Hall
                    in New York as well as the Rose Bowl Parade in 2017 and the New York Saint Patrick's Day Parade in 2019.
                    These experiences helped me grow as an individual and showed me the work required to perform at the highest levels.

                    Another passion of mine in college was being involved as a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. In this fraternity I
                    learned many skills and lessons that my other passions/education never taught me. In this organization, I started
                    as a new member and immediately took a leadership role as the Alumni Chair for the first year. This allowed to reach out 
                    to many of our beloved alumni and build connections early in my undergraduate degree. The second year, I chose to take a different
                    responsibility to assist in the transition of new members as Recruitment Chair. This helped build off the original skills 
                    of making connections. By my third year my work for the fraternity had been acknowledged and even though I had a busy schedule
                    with my commitments to my double major and the Cornhusker Marching Band I was elected to the Executive Board of the fraternity 
                    as Exchequer (treasurer). By the end of my time as Exchequer, our fraternity had its first year not in debt in 5 years and hasn't 
                    been in debt since. The leadership and life lessons taught to me in the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity is something I'll never forget.
